1. Overview
	SLDC (SQL-like Language Driven Crawl) is designed to collect contents from multi data sources simultaneously. It is supposed to get data from a local file, a web page, ftp file and database. I'd like to improve it step by step. 
	What's SQL-like driven? As we are visiting a database, we normally write SQL like this:
	select a.id, a.name from student a where a.id=1

	It's just a simple sentence to complete a job.
	What if we use such sentence to get contents from web and file?
	select $(a,'a','t'), $(b, '[0-9]+', 'r') from https://www.yahoo.com as a, /home/testfile as b

	Above line fetches all links in the Yahoo website and digits in a file. Seems easy?

2. Dependency
	SLDC is using antlr-4.2 as its language parsing engine. And Jsoup 1.7 as html parsing tool. 

3. Build
	1. Make sure antlr-4.2 is installed in the path where javac can find.
	2. Import Jsoup into the lib directory under your working path.
	3. enter src/org/sldc/csql/ and run 'generate' to create parsing classes in the same directory.
	4. Then everything becomes easier. :)

4. Starting
	Under sample directory, I put a compiled jar and a sample script in it.
	Simply run 'run.sh' in unix/linux or 'run.bat' in windows. There will be a 'dump.txt' generated.
	Refer to the outputs. 

5. Extension
	SLDC supports extensions for saving and build-in functions. Please refer to source codes in sample/extensions.jar.
	Extension must be named as extensions.jar or the same classes path it shows.

6. Future support
	I am an international student in US. And looking for jobs. SLDC is just a tool I'm writing to ease life.
	So I'm afraid not to have enough time to update it. But I will add more features into it such as FTP, DATABASE,
	POST body and authentication webpage etc. 
	In addition, if you have any job referal, I will be very happy. And welcome to contact me on SLDC or job position :)
